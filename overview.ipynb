    "Task 5: Task 5: Energy Consumption Forecasting for a Utility Company\n",
    "Expected duration: 5 days\n",
    "Task Overview\n",
    "Analytical Challenge and Business Context\n",
    "A utility company needs to forecast energy consumption for the next quarter to optimize grid operations. The task is to build a time series forecasting model using historical consumption data and recommend capacity planning strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Deliverables and Success Criteria\n",
    "Deliverables:\n",
    "A Python or R script for time series forecasting.\n",
    "A 2-3 page report with forecast results and capacity recommendations.\n",
    "Visualizations (e.g., forecast vs. actual, seasonality plots).\n",
    "Success Criteria:\n",
    "Forecast achieves MAPE < 10% on test data.\n",
    "Recommendations address peak demand periods.\n",
    "Visualizations clearly show trends and forecasts.\n",
    "Mock Dataset\n",
    "Dataset 1: Energy Consumption (CSV, 35,000 rows)\n",
    "Columns: Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM), Consumption (kWh), Region, CustomerType (Residential/Commercial).\n",
    "Complexities: 7% missing Consumption, outliers during holidays.\n",
    "Dataset 2: Weather Data (CSV, 10,000 rows)\n",
    "Columns: Date, Region, Temperature (°C), Humidity (%).\n",
    "Complexities: 5% missing Humidity, requires alignment with consumption data.\n",
    "Dataset 3: Region Metadata (CSV, 20 rows)\n",
    "Columns: Region, Population, IndustrialDensity (Low/Medium/High).\n",
    "Complexities: No missing values, but categorical encoding needed.\n",
    "Analytical Techniques and Tools\n",
    "Techniques:\n",
    "Data cleaning: Impute missing values, align timestamps.\n",
    "Time series analysis: Decompose trends, seasonality; use ARIMA or Prophet for forecasting.\n",
    "Feature engineering: Include weather and region features.\n",
    "Evaluation: MAPE, RMSE for forecast accuracy.\n",
    "Tools:\n",
    "Python (pandas, statsmodels, prophet, matplotlib) or R (forecast, ggplot2).\n",
    "SQL for data joins.\n",
    "Excel for initial exploration.\n",
    "Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "Forecast Accuracy: MAPE < 10%, RMSE < 500 kWh on test data.\n",
    "Data Quality: >95% of missing values resolved; timestamps aligned.\n",
    "Report Quality: Recommendations address peak demand (e.g., “Increase capacity in Region X for July”).\n",
    "Visualization: Includes time series plot and forecast confidence intervals.\n",
    "Time Estimate: 12h data cleaning/preprocessing, 10h time series analysis, 10h forecasting, 5h visualization, 3h report writing.\n"
